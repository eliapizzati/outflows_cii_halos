- Plan to do:
   - Create a "refine" branch where you can update add the relevant updates
      - Add the contribution of CMB suppression to the final luminosity
      - Include a new parameter theta to account for the dependence of the escape fraction 
      - Do not change v_esc since we know the mass of the single galaxies
      - Download the data from Fujimoto+20 and start the comparison with the single galaxies

   - Make a better structure for the scripts (a class maybe? introduce some function?) -- I'll take a look and try to work on it

   - I have to handle the folder structure in a better way -->  solution is to use os, sys

   - I also want to handle the plots in a more straightforward way! solution is to use matplotlib.rcParams.update()
